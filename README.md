# Stop turning your hats into pumpkins!
This pevents you from placing items with the `CustomModelData` NBT tag. All those fancy hats and stuff that you make out of carved pumpkins and resource packs won't be placed on the ground any more! It'll work server side, client side, or both.

## For Server Owners
When installed on **only** the server side, the items appear to be placed for a brief moment on the client side. Players will not get "lag back."

Requires Fabric API for versions <= 0.0.2.

## For Modpacks
You can add this to your modpack as long as it's still hosted on Modrinth.

## Known issues
Pre-1.17 versions will probably break with mods that mess with inventory size. A fix is not currently planned.
- If you know how to fix this, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/skycatminepokie/no-hat-for-da-ground/pulls)

## Questions and Contact
Ports: Make an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/skycatminepokie/no-hat-for-da-ground/issues) to request a version port. I won't port loaders.

Questions? Either make an issue or ping `@skycatminepokie` on the Fabric Development Discord server. Enjoy!
